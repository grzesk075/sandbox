 * Design a Parking Lot.
 * 1. Handling ambiguity. Ask general questions.
 * What it looks like? Is this open space or building with multiple levels? Is it free or paid?
 * Are there premium spots? How many spots, entrances and exits? How many acceptable vehicle sizes?
 * 2. Systematic approach. Ask system design questions.
 * Do we want class diagram or some code? Choose and discuss data structure, lookups and complexity.
 * Preferable is O(1) - big o (ou) of one.
 * Design dictionaries in enums and data flow in functions.
