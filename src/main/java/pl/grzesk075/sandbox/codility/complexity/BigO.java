/**
 * Time complexity depends on that, how increases number of dominant operations,
 * accordingly to increasing input data size.
 * Worst-case examples should be considered during measuring/estimation the complexity.
 * Time complexity is described in Big-O notation.
 * O(1)         constant            n % 2
 * O(n)         linear              for i in range(n): a *= i
 * O(log n)     logarithmic         while n > 1: n // 2; result += 1
